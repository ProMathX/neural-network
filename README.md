## Basic ideas behind it
Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) is a supervised learning algorithm that learns a function
by training on a dataset, where M is the number of dimensions for input and O is the number of dimensions for output.
Given a set of features and a target, it can learn a non-linear function approximator for either classification or regression.
It is different from logistic regression, in that between the input and the output layer, there can be one or more non-linear layers, called hidden layers.
